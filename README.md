# dkfs

This is an implementation of the simplest possible file system. This is just an asssignment and not for any actual use. It can help you if you want to understand how file systems work by doing some trivial tasks on the file system. For this, we have created our own super-inefficient filesystem.

### Building

I've only tested this on VS2015 on Windows 10 Build 10586, so I don't know about other platforms.

### Usage

#### WARNING: Before use, make sure you don't have a `D:\` as it will override it, and you will lose your data. I'd suggest making a virtual hard disk (.vhd) file of ~10-100MB and then use this executable.

Once you have compiled it, you'll have an executable (`dkfs.exe`) for interactive use.

For a list of commands, see [help.txt](help.txt), or enter h on the interactive prompt.
